Agile Ernad
===============

Regarding harbour, I have been living in comfort zone during last 5-10 years. 
I am not big "fun" of the language. It is my tool. So, that is the reason I have been totally relied on Viktor Szakats/Przemyslaw Czerpak with only change in the [postgresql libraries part](https://github.com/hernad/harbour-core) (my-master branch, which Viktor didn't want to accept).
 
The departure of these developers alarmed me that I shouldn't be passive. If I am passive, regardless the project is open-source, the vendor-lock in can be repeated in other form with [NOBODY-KNOWS-AND-NOBODY-CARES lock-in](https://github.com/hernad/harbour/blob/master/HARBOUR_AND_ME.md#year-1998-after-the-war-in-bosnia-i-have-catched-ptsd-caused-by-vendor-lock-in-sindrom-)

During [last 7 days](https://github.com/hernad/harbour/pulse), after 376 commits, I have learned about language a lot. I have approved to myself that I have enough C/Makefile/build systems knowledge to take care about my important tool.

Readings on this group (harbour users) have largely motivated me to do this step. To much talk about broad, unfocused ideas. To much talks like we are living in '90s of last century. And very often, the loudest voices by people who don't use it for living! 

> I prefer meritocracy over democracy in software development!

I am programmer. I live building and deploying harbour /  nodejs / electron / postgresql PL/PgSQL projects. Every of those tools are mine. If they are jeopardized, I am jeopardized.

I don't know what is the future for me or this community. I am glad that I am not passive observer in this story. 

I see my work as contributon to the harbour community, other can see that as a distraction to avoid. Never mind. 

I am alive, active and agile. These are most important things :).

Regards, Ernad
